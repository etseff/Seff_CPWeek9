CodePath Week 9 Assignment
 - __Honeypot deployed__: mhn Honeypot 1 was deployed.
 - __Issues encountered__: There was an issue connecting to the External IP address of the MHN admin at first, which was fixed by enabling HTTP and HTTPS. Also, NMAP could not be recognized at first, so I had to install it.Then, at the end of the process, there were issues downloading the JSON file which were fixed through using the GCP command line through the browser.
 - __Summary of data collected__: Attacks from all over the word were recorded on the honeypot. These attacked all different vulnerable ports using PCAP protocol. See the gif below.

 - __Unresolved questions raised by the data collected__: How do the attackers from other countries gain access to the honeypot I made?
 How does NMAP work? Do these machines from other countries just scan for vulnerable data sources anywhere in the world?
 - __JSON export__: The JSON file has been uploaded to this directory.
