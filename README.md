CodePath Week 9 Assignment
 - __Honeypot deployed__: mhn Honeypot 1 was deployed.
 - __Issues encountered__: There was an issue connecting to the External IP address of the MHN admin at first, which was fixed by enabling HTTP and HTTPS. Also, NMAP could not be recognized at first, so I had to install it.Then, at the end of the process, there were issues downloading the JSON file which were fixed through using the GCP command line through the browser.
 - __Summary of data collected__: Attacks from all over the word were recorded on the honeypot. These attacked all different vulnerable ports using PCAP protocol. See the image below.
